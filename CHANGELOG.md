# Needlelight Changelog

Source code adapted from: https://github.com/TheMulhima/Lumafly

[v6.1.0.3](#changes-in-v61103)

## Changes in v6.1.0.3

DATE: 2025-12-04

- Allows Silksong-only installs to register without detecting Hollow Knight first by accepting Linux/MacSteam/flatpak paths and macOS `.app` bundles during path selection.
- Launcher metadata now includes Silksong and Linux executable names so launching the correct binary no longer requires a hidden Hollow Knight install.
- Vanilla assembly discovery validates each manifest URL, skips 404 responses, and falls through to other sources so InstallVanilla succeeds even when upstream feeds misbehave.
- API toggles detect manual/BepInEx-heavy installs and keep the toggle responsive, ensuring Silksong/Hollow Knight auto-updates no longer crash when metadata is missing.

## Changes in v6.1.0.2

DATE: 2025-11-01

- Aligns ModLinks, API manifests, and vanilla assembly endpoints per game profile with resilient fallbacks for Silksong.
- Fixes Silksong macOS launch detection by targeting the `.app/Contents/MacOS` executable path.
- Adds defensive API toggle behaviour and nullability cleanups to keep Hollow Knight compatibility intact.
